Starting with Ubuntu 17.04, the swap partition was replaced by a swap file. The main advantage of the swap file is easy resizing.
In the following example, weâ€™ll extend the swap space available in the /swapfile from 4 GB to 8 GB.

Setup swap

	Turn off all swap processes
		sudo swapoff -a

	Resize the swap to 4GB
		sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1G count=4
		
		if = input file
		of = output file
		bs = block size
		count = multiplier of blocks

	Make the file usable as swap
		sudo mkswap /swapfile

	Activate the swap file
		sudo swapon /swapfile

	Check the amount of swap available
		grep SwapTotal /proc/meminfo

Hibernate activation

	get partition of the root path
		mount | grep " / "

	get UUID of the root partition from above
		sudo blkid

	get first "physical" number -> resume_offset
		sudo filefrag -v /swapfile

	set the resume and resume_offset: "resume=UUID=cdXX--X18 resume_offset=yyyyyy"
		sudo -b gedit /etc/default/grub

	Configure Grub to resume from the swapfile by editing /etc/default/grub and modify the following line
		GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="resume=UUID=20562a02-cfa6-42e0-bb9f-5e936ea763d0 resume_offset=34818 quiet splash"

	Activate the new grub configuration
		sudo update-grub

	Test if hibernate works
		systemctl hibernate

	Add hibernate icon
		sudo desktop-file-install ./hibernate_computer.desktop
